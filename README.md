# CS First Year Projects

## Project 1: Data Visualizations to Analyze COVID-19 in the US | Python
- **Duration**: Aug. 2022 â€“ Sept. 2022
- **Description**: This project focused on generating visualizations to analyze the impact of COVID-19 in the United States. The visualizations aimed to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 cases and mortality rates, considering various factors such as community health, socio-economic indicators, and mobility trends. Python was utilized as the primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.

## Project 2: Research on Recommender Systems in Computer Science
- **Description**: This project involved conducting a literature review on recommender systems, a technology widely employed by websites to provide personalized recommendations to users. The focus was on surveying recent papers and research articles in the field of computer science, particularly those related to recommender systems. The objective was to gain insights into the latest advancements, methodologies, and algorithms used in building effective recommender systems.

## Presentations
Both projects were presented as part of an advanced course in the Computer Science degree program. The presentations showcased the findings, methodologies, and insights gained from the respective projects to peers and faculty members.

## Learning Outcomes
- Developed skills in data analysis, visualization, and interpretation using Python.
- Gained knowledge about the complexities and challenges associated with analyzing large-scale datasets such as COVID-19 statistics.
- Explored the theoretical and practical aspects of recommender systems, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.
- Enhanced understanding of research methodologies and critical analysis through the literature review process.
